# AlpenSign

**Transaction sealing for banks on Solana Seeker.**

With AlpenSign, the client cryptographically signs the payment — and the proof lives on a public ledger, not only on the bank's server.

## What is AlpenSign?

AlpenSign turns the Solana Seeker phone into a **Mobile HSM** (Hardware Security Module) — an independent, client-side device that seals bank payments and Visa 3D-Secure transactions with biometric confirmation and posts cryptographic proof to Solana.

**No bank server. No Apple. No Google. No AlpenSign backend.**
The Seeker phone signs, TEEPIN attests, Solana records. The only intermediary is math.

### The Problem

When a client disputes a payment, the bank's defense rests on server logs they generated, stored, and control. That's self-serving evidence. Courts know it. Regulators know it. Fraudsters know it. Banks lose billions annually to friendly fraud because they cannot independently prove the client authorized the payment.

### The Solution

AlpenSign creates an independent evidence chain — from verified hardware through verified identity to immutable proof of authorization — using three layers of cryptographic trust.

---

## Three-Layer Trust Model

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  LAYER 1 - Genesis Token                                          |
|  Device is genuine                                                |
|  Soulbound NFT, TEEPIN/SKR Guardians, Decentralized              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  LAYER 2 - Bank Credential                                        |
|  Client is authorized                                             |
|  Solana Attestation Service (SAS), Revocable by bank              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  LAYER 3 - Transaction Seal                                       |
|  Payment is confirmed                                             |
|  Biometric + Seed Vault signature, On-chain memo, Immutable       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Layer 1 — Genesis Token (Device Identity):** The Seeker's soulbound NFT proves the phone is real hardware, verified by SKR-staked Guardians through TEEPIN. No Apple. No Google. No centralized attestation.

**Layer 2 — Bank Credential (Client Identity):** The bank issues a verifiable credential via Solana Attestation Service, binding the client to the verified device. The bank retains full control — credentials are revocable at any time.

**Layer 3 — Transaction Seal (Payment Authorization):** The client reviews the payment, confirms with biometric authentication. The Seeker's Seed Vault signs and AlpenSign posts the proof directly to Solana. Permanent and immutable.

## How It Works

### Enrollment (one-time setup)

```
1. Initialize Vault     →  WebAuthn credential created in Seeker's secure element
                            (ECDSA P-256, biometric-gated)

2. Connect Seed Vault   →  MWA wallet authorization
                            AlpenSign receives the Seeker's Solana wallet address
                            Genesis Token verified against mainnet (real on-chain check)

3. Bank Confirmation    →  Bank issues SAS credential binding client to device
                            (simulated in hackathon demo)
```

### Sealing a Payment

```
1. Receive request      →  Payment details delivered to AlpenSign
                            (currently simulated; production: deep link / push / QR)

2. Review & confirm     →  Client reviews recipient, amount, IBAN, reference
                            Taps "Seal with Biometric"

3. Biometric auth       →  WebAuthn assertion with userVerification: "required"
                            Seeker prompts fingerprint or PIN

4. Hash & sign          →  SHA-256 hash of payment data
                            Seed Vault signs the memo transaction

5. Post to Solana       →  MWA sign-and-send via Seed Vault
                            Memo containing payment hash posted to devnet

6. Confirmation         →  Transaction ID returned
                            Verifiable on Solana Explorer
```

### Evidence Chain

After sealing, the bank (or a court) can independently verify:

- **Device genuineness** → Genesis Token NFT in the signing wallet
- **Client identity** → SAS credential linking wallet to bank client record
- **Payment authorization** → On-chain transaction with payment hash, signed by Seed Vault

The bank computes the same SHA-256 hash from the original payment request. If it matches the on-chain memo, the seal is valid. The client cannot deny authorization without explaining how their biometric was used inside a verified secure element.

This is a **zero-build-step project**. No bundler, no transpiler, no `npm install`, no backend. This is intentional — auditability over convenience. A bank compliance officer can View Source and read every line. The `site/` folder is deployed as-is to any static host.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Solana Seeker phone** (recommended) — full trust chain with Seed Vault + Genesis Token
- Any **Android device** — works with reduced trust level (no on-chain sealing without MWA)
- A modern browser (Chrome recommended for WebAuthn support)

### Run Locally

No build step. No `npm install`. Just serve the `site/` folder.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/gbits-io/alpensign.git
cd alpensign/site

# Serve with any static server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/app.html` on your Seeker or Android device.

> **Note:** MWA (Mobile Wallet Adapter) requires the app to be served over HTTPS or localhost. For testing on a Seeker over the network, use a tool like `ngrok` or deploy to a hosting provider.

### Deploy

Deploy the `site/` folder to any static host:

```bash
# Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir site

# Vercel
vercel --prod --root-directory site

# GitHub Pages
# Enable in repo settings → Pages → Source: main branch, /site folder
```

The live version runs at [alpensign.com](https://alpensign.com).

## Current Status (v0.7.0)

### What works

- ✅ WebAuthn enrollment with platform authenticator (Seeker secure element)
- ✅ MWA wallet connection via Seed Vault
- ✅ Genesis Token verification — real mainnet on-chain Token-2022 check via Helius RPC (Layer 1)
- ✅ Biometric-gated payment sealing
- ✅ SHA-256 payment hash computation
- ✅ On-chain posting via Solana Memo Program (mainnet or devnet, configurable)
- ✅ Transaction verification on Solana Explorer
- ✅ Seal history with full details
- ✅ Bank simulator with BroadcastChannel bridge and real wallet address sync
- ✅ Challenge signing for bank pairing (WebAuthn over bank challenge string)
- ✅ Mainnet/devnet network toggle in Settings
- ✅ "Open Bank Portal" button launches bank simulator from AlpenSign
- ✅ Graceful degradation on non-Seeker Android devices
- ✅ Landing page with demo video, security comparison, and [llms.txt](https://alpensign.com/llms.txt)

### Known Limitations

- ⚠️ **Bank credential** — Layer 2 (SAS credential issuance) requires bank cooperation and is simulated for the hackathon.
- ⚠️ **Payment delivery** — Seal requests arrive via BroadcastChannel from bank simulator. Production delivery via deep link, push notification, or QR code is planned.
- ⚠️ **Helius dependency** — Public Solana RPCs block browser requests (403). Helius API key required in `config.js`. Free tier is sufficient.
- ⚠️ **Seal history** — Stored in `localStorage`. Lost on browser data clear or device reset.
- ⚠️ **`.skr` resolution** — Bank simulator uses AlpenSign's wallet address (via localStorage), not on-chain ANS domain lookup.

---

## Regulatory Alignment

AlpenSign's architecture aligns with existing and emerging regulatory frameworks:

- **QES-comparable** — Biometric + secure element + hardware-isolated keys: structurally equivalent to Qualified Electronic Signatures under eIDAS
- **GDPR by design** — No personal data on-chain. Only cryptographic hashes. Biometrics stay on-device.
- **Immutable audit trail** — Timestamped, tamper-proof record on Solana. Supports FINMA, MiFID II, and PSD2/SCA requirements.
- **Swiss & EU compatible** — Aligns with ZertES, eIDAS trust services, and PSD2 independent authentication requirements.

---

## Why Solana Seeker?

AlpenSign requires capabilities that don't exist on iPhone or Pixel:

| Capability | Apple / Google | Solana Seeker |
|---|---|---|
| On-chain device identity | ✗ None | ✓ Genesis Token (soulbound) |
| Decentralized device attestation | ✗ Centralized, revocable | ✓ TEEPIN + Guardians |
| Native blockchain signing in secure element | ✗ None | ✓ Seed Vault |
| Vendor-free trust chain | ✗ Apple / Google in the middle | ✓ Math + decentralized network |
| Direct-to-chain posting | ✗ Requires backend relay | ✓ Solana Mobile Stack |

---

## Device Recovery

When a client loses their Seeker, the process is simple:

1. Bank revokes the old SAS credential
2. Client sets up new Seeker (Genesis Token auto-minted, Seed Vault initialized)
3. Client opens AlpenSign and re-enrolls — identical to first-time setup
4. Bank re-issues credential via existing identity channel

There is no "AlpenSign account" to migrate. Seal history remains permanently on Solana. Target: under 5 minutes with online banking access. See [Section 10e of the roadmap](docs/AlpenSign_Extension_Roadmap.md) for details.
