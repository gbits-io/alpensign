## Executive Summary

AlpenSign proves that independent, cryptographic attestation of human decisions is technically feasible using commodity hardware (Solana Seeker) and public blockchains. The current product targets a narrow use case: payment authorization seals for banks.

This document describes the strategic evolution from **AlpenSign** (a transaction-sealing app) into **SwissAttest** (a Swiss-domiciled attestation authority for AI-era verification). The thesis: as AI-generated content floods every industry, the demand for proving "a real human made this decision / wrote this / approved this" will become a multi-billion-dollar market. Switzerland's institutional credibility, neutrality, and legal framework make it the natural home for this infrastructure.

SwissAttest is not a pivot away from AlpenSign — it is AlpenSign's natural destination. Every layer of the AlpenSign stack (device verification, credential issuance, cryptographic sealing, evidence bundles) generalizes directly to the broader attestation market.

## 1. The Concept: Swiss Attestation Authority for AI Outputs

### 1.1 The Problem in Detail

By 2028–2030, the following will be routine:

- AI systems drafting and filing legal documents, contracts, and regulatory submissions
- AI-generated financial reports, audit opinions, and investment research
- AI-produced medical diagnoses, treatment plans, and insurance assessments
- AI-written news articles, corporate communications, and marketing content
- AI agents negotiating, executing, and settling commercial transactions autonomously

The fundamental question in every one of these scenarios: **"Was a qualified human involved in this decision, and can you prove it?"**

Today's answer is: "Trust us, a human reviewed it." This is the same self-serving evidence problem AlpenSign already solves for bank payments. The AI age scales this problem to every industry simultaneously.

### 1.2 What SwissAttest Does

SwissAttest provides **legally recognized, cryptographically anchored attestation** that a specific human, using a verified device, reviewed and approved a specific document or decision at a specific time. The attestation is:

- **Independent** — not controlled by the organization that produced the document
- **Immutable** — anchored on-chain (Solana) with off-chain evidence bundles
- **Legally structured** — issued under Swiss law, designed for cross-border recognition
- **Privacy-preserving** — only cryptographic proofs on-chain, full data held by parties

Think of it as **"Swiss Made" for information integrity** — the same trust premium Switzerland commands for watches, banking, and arbitration, applied to the question of human authorship and approval in the AI age.

### 1.3 Three Concrete Examples

#### Example A: AI-Assisted Legal Contract — "Who Actually Approved This?"

**Scenario:** A Zürich-based law firm uses an AI system to draft a complex M&A agreement. The AI produces a 200-page contract. A senior partner reviews and approves the final version. Six months later, a clause is disputed, and the opposing party claims the contract was "fully AI-generated with no meaningful human review" — attempting to argue diminished legal authority.

**How SwissAttest works here:**

1. The law firm's document management system integrates the SwissAttest SDK.
2. When the partner opens the final draft for review, SwissAttest records the session: device identity (verified Seeker or hardware token), biometric confirmation (the partner, not an assistant), document hash (SHA-256 of the exact PDF).
3. The partner reads, makes final edits, and taps "Approve & Seal" on their verified device.
4. SwissAttest posts a cryptographic seal to Solana: the document hash, the partner's credential (issued by the firm, bound to their Swiss bar admission), the device attestation, and a timestamp.
5. The firm receives an **evidence bundle** — a self-contained package (PDF + JSON + on-chain references) that proves: this specific person, on this verified device, approved this exact document, at this exact time.

**In the dispute:** The firm presents the SwissAttest evidence bundle. The opposing party cannot credibly claim "no human reviewed it" — the cryptographic chain proves a named, credentialed partner spent 47 minutes in the document and biometrically sealed their approval. The attestation is independent of the firm's own systems.

**Revenue model:** Per-attestation fee (CHF 2–5 per seal) + annual firm subscription for the SDK and credential management.

#### Example B: AI-Generated Medical Diagnosis — "Did a Doctor Actually See This?"

**Scenario:** A Swiss health insurer receives a claim based on a diagnosis generated by an AI diagnostic system at a cantonal hospital. The AI analyzed imaging data and produced a diagnosis of a condition requiring expensive treatment. The insurer questions whether a qualified physician meaningfully reviewed the AI's output before the diagnosis was issued.

**How SwissAttest works here:**

1. The hospital's radiology department uses an AI-assisted diagnostic platform.
2. The AI flags a finding and drafts a diagnostic report. A board-certified radiologist reviews the imaging and the AI's analysis on their workstation.
3. The radiologist's SwissAttest credential (bound to their FMH medical license via SAS attestation) is active on their verified device.
4. After reviewing the images and confirming or modifying the AI's finding, the radiologist seals the final diagnostic report via SwissAttest.
5. The seal captures: the radiologist's medical credential, device verification, biometric confirmation, the hash of the final diagnostic report (including any modifications from the AI draft), and the viewing duration.

**In the insurance dispute:** The hospital presents the SwissAttest evidence bundle. It proves that Dr. [Name], FMH-certified radiologist, reviewed the imaging data for 12 minutes on a verified device and biometrically sealed the modified diagnosis. The insurer's concern about "rubber-stamped AI output" is addressed with independent, cryptographic proof of physician involvement.

**Why Swiss:** Swiss medical data protection (nDSG) is stringent. SwissAttest's privacy-preserving design (only hashes on-chain, full data held by the hospital) aligns with Swiss health data regulations. Switzerland's reputation for medical excellence adds credibility to the attestation framework.

**Revenue model:** Per-attestation fee + hospital/clinic subscription + potential integration with Swiss health insurance infrastructure (SASIS, TARMED successors).

#### Example C: Financial Research Report — "Is This Human Analysis or AI Slop?"

**Scenario:** A Swiss asset management firm publishes investment research to institutional clients. Regulators (FINMA, and increasingly MiFID II for EU-distributed research) require that published research reflects genuine analyst judgment. The firm uses AI to assist with data gathering and draft generation, but the final opinions and recommendations must be human. A competing firm files a complaint alleging that the research is essentially AI-generated and misleadingly attributed to named analysts.

**How SwissAttest works here:**

1. The research platform integrates SwissAttest into the analyst workflow.
2. An analyst uses AI tools to compile data, generate charts, and draft sections. The AI's contributions are logged internally.
3. The analyst reviews the full report, writes the conclusion and investment recommendation, and seals the final version via SwissAttest on their verified device.
4. The seal captures: the analyst's credential (bound to their FINMA-registered role at the firm), the document hash of the final report, the biometric confirmation, and crucially — the **diff between the AI draft and the final sealed version**, proving the analyst made substantive modifications.

**In the regulatory inquiry:** FINMA requests evidence that the research reflects genuine analyst judgment. The firm provides SwissAttest evidence bundles for each published report, showing: which analyst sealed each report, how long they spent reviewing, and what changes they made to the AI draft. The competing firm's complaint is addressed with auditable, independent proof.

**Why this is different from "just signing a PDF":** A digital signature proves the file wasn't tampered with after signing. SwissAttest proves the **process** — that a qualified human engaged with the content on a verified device for a meaningful duration before approval. It's the difference between notarizing a signature and witnessing a decision.

**Revenue model:** Per-report attestation fee (CHF 5–15 for financial research, given regulatory value) + annual compliance subscription + FINMA audit-readiness package.

### 1.4 The Core Technical Stack (Built on AlpenSign)

| AlpenSign Component | SwissAttest Generalization |
|---|---|
| Genesis Token (device is genuine Seeker) | **Device Attestation Layer** — Genesis Token for Seeker, manufacturer attestation for Ledger/Trezor/Yubikey, TPM attestation for enterprise laptops |
| Bank Credential (SAS attestation from bank) | **Professional Credential Layer** — SAS attestation from any credentialing authority: law firms, medical boards, financial regulators, corporate HR |
| Transaction Seal (biometric + payment hash on Solana) | **Decision Seal** — biometric confirmation + document/decision hash on Solana, with session metadata (duration, interaction pattern, modifications) |
| Evidence Bundle (court-admissible package) | **Attestation Certificate** — self-contained, legally structured evidence package designed for cross-jurisdictional recognition |

Every piece of AlpenSign's architecture maps directly. The SDK, HSM integration (Securosys), privacy enhancements (ZK proofs), and credential recovery flows all carry over unchanged.

## 2. Competitive Landscape

### 2.1 Companies Operating in Adjacent Spaces

**DocuSign / Adobe Sign (e-signatures)**
These platforms prove a document was signed, but not that the signer meaningfully reviewed or understood the content. They also rely on centralized trust — DocuSign is the sole authority on whether a signature is valid. SwissAttest adds the decision-process layer (time spent, modifications made, device verification) and decentralizes the trust anchor.

**Worldcoin / World ID (proof of humanness)**
World ID proves "this is a real human" via iris scanning. It does not prove "this human is qualified to make this decision" or "this human actually reviewed this specific document." SwissAttest builds on the proof-of-humanness concept but adds professional credentials and document-specific sealing. World ID could be a complementary identity layer.

**OpenAI's Content Credentials / C2PA (content provenance)**
The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), backed by Adobe, Microsoft, and others, focuses on tagging AI-generated content with provenance metadata. This is the supply-side approach: labeling what AI made. SwissAttest is the demand-side complement: proving what a human approved. They are not competitors but natural partners — C2PA tags the AI's contribution, SwissAttest seals the human's approval.

**Notarize / eNotarize platforms**
Digital notarization platforms bring traditional notarial functions online. They are limited to notarial acts (identity verification, witnessing signatures) and operate within specific legal jurisdictions. SwissAttest goes beyond notarization to continuous process attestation — not just "this person signed" but "this person engaged with this content for X minutes and made Y modifications on a verified device."

**Civic / RNS.ID / Sumsub (identity verification on Solana)**
These Solana-ecosystem companies provide identity verification and credentialing using SAS attestations. They are potential partners, not competitors — Civic's identity verification could feed into SwissAttest's professional credential issuance. The key differentiation: these companies verify identity; SwissAttest verifies decisions.

**Securitize / tZERO (regulated digital securities)**
These platforms handle securities issuance and compliance on blockchain. They face the same "who approved this?" question for regulatory filings and compliance decisions. They are potential enterprise customers for SwissAttest, not competitors.

### 2.2 Why No One Has Built This Yet

Three reasons:

1. **The AI trust crisis hasn't peaked yet.** In 2026, most organizations are still excited about AI capabilities and haven't internalized the liability problem. By 2028–2030, the first wave of lawsuits over AI-generated errors in legal, medical, and financial contexts will create urgent demand.

2. **The hardware didn't exist.** Before the Solana Seeker (and similar secure-element phones), there was no consumer device that could produce cryptographic attestations from a hardware-isolated signing environment with biometric gating. Laptops have TPMs but no biometric-gated signing flow. The Seeker is the first device where "biometric + secure element + on-chain" is a single user gesture.

3. **Switzerland hasn't positioned itself yet.** The Swiss government and FINMA are focused on crypto regulation and DeFi, not on AI attestation infrastructure. The opportunity is to build the private-sector framework before the regulatory mandate arrives — and then be the incumbent when it does.

## 5. Why Switzerland — The Structural Advantages

1. **Legal neutrality.** Swiss attestations are not subject to US subpoena, EU jurisdiction shopping, or Chinese data access requirements. For multinational organizations, a Swiss attestation authority is uniquely neutral.

2. **ZertES framework.** Swiss electronic signatures law already provides legal frameworks for qualified electronic signatures and seals. SwissAttest certificates can be designed to fit within (or extend) this framework.

3. **FINMA and banking trust.** Switzerland's existing reputation for financial trust transfers directly to information trust. "Swiss-attested" carries the same premium as "Swiss-made" or "Swiss-banked."

4. **Energy and infrastructure.** Switzerland's hydropower-dominated energy grid provides sustainable, low-cost electricity for any computational infrastructure. Cool alpine climate is ideal for data center operations.

5. **Data protection.** The new Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (nDSG) provides strong privacy guarantees that align with SwissAttest's privacy-preserving design. Swiss data protection is recognized by the EU as "adequate," enabling cross-border data flows.

6. **Talent and ecosystem.** ETH Zürich, EPFL, Swiss Crypto Valley (Zug), and the established fintech ecosystem provide both technical talent and institutional credibility.

## 6. Risks and Open Questions

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| AI trust crisis doesn't materialize as expected | AlpenSign (banking) remains a viable standalone business regardless |
| Regulatory framework moves faster than SwissAttest can establish | Early engagement with FINMA, BJ (Federal Office of Justice), and industry associations |
| C2PA or similar consortium captures the standard | Position SwissAttest as complementary (human approval) not competing (content tagging) |
| Device ecosystem remains too narrow (Seeker-only) | Phase 2 explicitly expands to Ledger, Trezor, Yubikey, enterprise TPM |
| Swiss legal recognition is slow or uncertain | Build market adoption first; legal recognition follows commercial traction |
| Established e-signature companies (DocuSign, Adobe) move into this space | Their architecture is centralized and not designed for process attestation; SwissAttest's on-chain independence is structurally different |

---

## 7. Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete AlpenSign Phase 1** — the banking use case validates the entire technical stack and provides revenue while SwissAttest is developed
2. **File Swiss trademark for "SwissAttest"** — protect the brand early
3. **Draft a white paper** — "Human Attestation in the AI Age: A Swiss Framework" for distribution to legal, medical, and financial industry contacts
4. **Engage ETH Zürich** — explore academic partnership for research on cryptographic attestation of human decision processes
5. **Map the legal landscape** — commission a legal opinion on how SwissAttest certificates would be treated under ZertES, eIDAS, and common-law evidence rules
