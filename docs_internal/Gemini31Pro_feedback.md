Investor Feedback & Roadmap Enhancements: AlpenSign / SwissAttest
Date: February 23, 2026
Perspective: Dual-lens assessment (Swiss B2B Angel + Web3 Institutional VC)
Document Reviewed: SwissAttest_Strategic_Roadmap_CONFIDENTIAL.md (v1.1)

1. Executive Summary & Investment Thesis
The transition from AlpenSign (a narrow banking use case) to SwissAttest (a generalized AI-era attestation authority) is a highly defensible infrastructure play. The core thesis—that the proliferation of AI will create a multi-billion-dollar market for proving human involvement in high-stakes decisions—is fundamentally correct.

You have correctly identified that self-serving internal logs will fail under legal and regulatory scrutiny. The solution is not looking for a problem; it is front-running a massive, inevitable liability crisis in the legal, medical, and financial sectors.

2. Timing and the "MediaTek Catalyst"
In your current roadmap, Phase 2 mentions expanding beyond the Solana Seeker to "Ledger, Trezor, Yubikey, enterprise TPM devices".

Crucial Update Needed for v1.2: The recent announcements regarding Solana Mobile’s partnership with MediaTek and Trustonic (bringing TEE and biometric-to-chain signing to mainstream Android devices) fundamentally changes your Total Addressable Market (TAM).

The Hardware Bottleneck is Solved: You no longer need to convince banks or hospitals to distribute niche crypto-phones or hardware wallets.

Roadmap Adjustment: Phase 2 should explicitly highlight the MediaTek TEEPIN integration. This transitions SwissAttest from a hardware-dependent deployment to a highly scalable software SDK that enterprise clients can deploy to the millions of compatible Android devices their employees already own.

3. Structural Strengths (What Investors Love)
The "Swiss" Brand Positioning: Leveraging Switzerland's institutional credibility, the ZertES legal framework, and the nDSG data protection framework is a brilliant moat. "Swiss Made for information integrity" is a highly marketable B2B narrative.

The JTBD Framework: The Jobs-To-Be-Done analysis is exceptionally strong. Acknowledging that the "hiring moment" is driven by fear of regulatory or legal disputes (the "struggling moment" when an external party questions human involvement) shows deep commercial maturity. The Pixar story of Dr. Elena Furrer perfectly encapsulates the emotional and functional value.

Web3 Infrastructure: Building on Solana for high-throughput, low-cost transaction sealing, and utilizing SAS (Solana Attestation Service) for professional credentialing is exactly how public blockchains should be leveraged for enterprise data integrity.

4. Key Risks & Vulnerabilities to Address
Schizophrenic Go-To-Market (GTM): Phase 1 targets bank fraud departments. Phase 2 and 3 target law firms, hospitals, and eventually the creation of a multi-stakeholder governance body (the SwissAttest Verein). These are entirely different sales motions. Selling anti-fraud software to UBS is not the same as establishing a medical liability standard with the FMH.

The Enterprise Security Trade-off: Expanding to mainstream MediaTek devices drastically increases the attack surface compared to the tightly controlled Seeker phone. Proving to FINMA or Swiss courts that a biometric seal generated on a budget Android phone is "immutable and legally binding" will require rigorous, expensive security audits.

The Legacy Threat: You correctly note that DocuSign and Adobe currently rely on centralized trust. However, do not underestimate their distribution power. If they acquire a Web3 startup to bolt on decentralized process attestation, they could lock you out of the enterprise market.

5. Actionable Recommendations for Roadmap v1.2
To make this fully fundable at a Seed/Series A level, we recommend adding the following elements to your next document iteration:

Integrate the MediaTek/Universal Android Strategy: Explicitly map out how SwissAttest will ride the rollout of TEE-enabled Android chips. This is your primary scaling mechanism for Phase 2.

Clarify the Regulatory Milestones: In Section 7 (Immediate Next Steps), add a specific milestone for obtaining a preliminary legal opinion on how these specific hardware-generated seals map to Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) under ZertES.

Define the "Bridge" to Phase 2: Explain how the revenue and client relationships from the Phase 1 banking pilots will directly fund and facilitate the transition to the generalized SDK. Will your banking partners become the first credential issuers?

Add a Hardware Security/Audit Budget: Acknowledge the security fragmentation risks of expanding to general Android TPMs and allocate a budget/timeline for third-party penetration testing and EMFI (electromagnetic fault injection) resilience audits.
