# AlpenSign

> AlpenSign is a transaction sealing solution for banks built on the Solana Seeker phone. It turns the Seeker's secure element and Solana blockchain into an independent second-channel authorization layer for bank payments — creating immutable, biometric-confirmed, cryptographic proof of payment authorization on a neutral public ledger.

AlpenSign was built for the Solana Seeker Hackathon Monolith (Q1 2026) by a Swiss fintech team. The core idea: the phone doesn't replace the bank's authentication — it independently attests that the client confirmed the transaction. This produces evidence that is not controlled by the bank, making it structurally stronger than self-serving server logs in disputes and fraud cases.

## Architecture

AlpenSign implements a three-layer trust model:

1. **Genesis Token** (Layer 1 — Device Identity): The Seeker's soulbound NFT proves the phone is genuine hardware, verified by SKR-staked Guardians through TEEPIN. No Apple or Google attestation required.
2. **Bank Credential** (Layer 2 — Client Identity): The bank issues a credential via Solana Attestation Service (SAS) to the Seeker wallet, binding the client relationship to the verified device. Revocable by the bank.
3. **Transaction Seal** (Layer 3 — Payment Authorization): The client reviews payment details on-device, confirms with biometric. The Seeker's secure element signs and AlpenSign posts the proof to Solana. Permanent and immutable.

## Transaction Sealing Flow

1. Bank Client initiates payment via Mobile Banking App
2. Mobile Banking App sends a signing request to AlpenSign
3. AlpenSign requests a signature from Solana Seeker (biometric confirmation via Seed Vault)
4. Seeker returns the signed payload to AlpenSign
5. AlpenSign posts the seal to Solana Blockchain (SAS attestation)
6. Mobile Banking App verifies the seal on Solana

## Setup & Enrollment Flow

1. Solana Seeker connects wallet to AlpenSign
2. AlpenSign sends enrollment request to Bank
3. Bank verifies Genesis Token and issues SAS credential on Solana
4. Bank mints a soulbound Client NFT to the Seeker wallet
5. AlpenSign is enrolled and ready to seal transactions

## Technology Stack

- **Seeker Seed Vault**: Hardware-isolated key storage with biometric-gated signing. Keys never leave the secure element.
- **Solana Attestation Service (SAS)**: Permissionless credential protocol from the Solana Foundation. Used for both bank credentials and transaction seals.
- **Solana Mobile Stack**: Native wallet integration, dApp runtime, and TEEPIN device verification.
- **TEEPIN + SKR Guardians**: Trusted Execution Environment Platform Infrastructure Network. SKR-staked Guardians verify device authenticity.

## Key Differentiators vs Apple / Google Devices

- On-chain device identity (Genesis Token) — Apple/Google have none
- Decentralized device genuineness proof (TEEPIN + Guardians) — vs centralized Play Integrity / DeviceCheck
- Bank credential bound to hardware wallet — vs no hardware binding
- Trust dependency on math + decentralized network — vs revocable, opaque vendor control
- No single party can revoke — vs vendor revocation at will

## Regulatory Alignment

- Cryptographic seals are structurally comparable to Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) under eIDAS: identity-bound, non-repudiable, tamper-evident
- GDPR-aligned: no personal data stored on-chain, only cryptographic hashes. Biometrics stay on-device in the secure element.
- Immutable audit trail supports FINMA, MiFID II, and PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) record-keeping requirements
- Compatible with Switzerland's ZertES (Federal Act on Electronic Signatures) and the EU eIDAS trust services framework

## Problem Statement

Banks lose billions to fraud and friendly fraud. Their only defense in disputes is server logs they generated, stored, and control — structurally weak self-serving evidence. SMS OTP, push notifications, and app-based 2FA all depend on bank or Big Tech infrastructure with no independent verifiable trail. The burden of proof sits with the bank. AlpenSign's independent cryptographic evidence enables a potential reversal of the burden of proof.
