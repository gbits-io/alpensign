## What is AlpenSign?
AlpenSign turns the Solana Seeker phone into a Mobile HSM (Hardware Security Module) — an independent, client-side device that seals bank payments and Visa 3D-Secure transactions with biometric confirmation and posts the proof to an immutable public ledger.

No bank server. No Apple. No Google. No AlpenSign backend. The Seeker phone signs, TEEPIN attests, Solana records. The only intermediary is math. The proof lives on a public ledger, not only on the bank's server.

## The Problem
When a client disputes a payment, the bank's defense rests on server logs they generated, stored, and control. That's self-serving evidence. Courts know it. Regulators know it. Fraudsters know it. Banks lose billions annually to friendly fraud because they cannot independently prove the client authorized the payment.

## Three-Layer Trust Model

### Layer 1: Genesis Token — Device is genuine
The Seeker's soulbound NFT proves the phone is real hardware, verified by SKR-staked Guardians through TEEPIN. No centralized attestation from Apple or Google.

### Layer 2: Bank Credential — Client is authorized
The bank issues a verifiable credential via Solana Attestation Service (SAS), binding the client's identity to the verified device. Revocable by the bank at any time.

### Layer 3: Transaction Seal — Payment is confirmed
The client reviews the payment, confirms with biometric authentication. The Seeker's Seed Vault signs, and AlpenSign posts the proof directly to Solana. Permanent and immutable.

## Key USP
AlpenSign is the only payment authorization layer that removes the bank, Apple, Google, *and itself* from the trust chain. There is no AlpenSign server component (besides a stateless, replaceable relay to the Solana RPC endpoint). Every other approach either relies on the bank's own infrastructure (self-serving), depends on Apple/Google attestation (centralized, revocable), or introduces a third-party signing service that becomes a new single point of trust.

## Tech Stack
- **Seeker Seed Vault**: Hardware-isolated key storage with biometric-gated signing. Keys never leave the secure element.
- **Solana Attestation Service (SAS)**: On-chain attestation protocol for verifiable credentials and transaction seals.
- **Solana Mobile Stack / MWA**: Native wallet integration via Mobile Wallet Adapter, dApp runtime, and TEEPIN device verification.
- **TEEPIN + SKR Guardians**: Decentralized device attestation. Guardians stake SKR tokens — fraudulent attestation means slashing.
- **Soulbound NFTs**: Non-transferable Genesis Token anchoring device identity on-chain.

## TEEPIN & SKR Economy
Traditional device attestation depends on Apple or Google. TEEPIN replaces that with economic skin-in-the-game: independent Guardians stake SKR tokens to attest Seeker hardware integrity. If a Guardian falsely attests a compromised device, they lose their stake. For banks, the device behind every AlpenSign seal is verified by a decentralized network with real financial consequences.

## Regulatory Alignment
- **QES-comparable**: Biometric + secure element + hardware-isolated keys, structurally equivalent to Qualified Electronic Signatures under eIDAS.
- **GDPR by design**: No personal data on-chain. Only cryptographic hashes. Biometrics stay on-device.
- **Immutable audit trail**: Timestamped, tamper-proof record on Solana. Supports FINMA, MiFID II, and PSD2/SCA requirements.
- **Swiss & EU compatible**: Aligns with ZertES, eIDAS trust services, and PSD2 independent authentication requirements.

## Why Solana Seeker? (What's not possible on iPhone or Pixel)
- No on-chain device identity (no Genesis Token equivalent)
- No decentralized device attestation (Play Integrity / DeviceCheck are centralized and revocable)
- No native Solana signing in the secure element
- No vendor-free trust chain (Apple/Google sit in the middle)
- No direct-to-chain posting from the device without a server relay

## Device Recovery
When a client loses their Seeker, the bank revokes the old SAS credential and the client re-enrolls on a new device through the same onboarding flow — no special recovery mode needed. AlpenSign has no server or user accounts, so there is nothing to "migrate." The seal history remains permanently on Solana. If the client backed up their seed phrase, they can restore the same wallet address; otherwise, a new wallet works equally well. The design goal is under 5 minutes for a client with online banking access.

## Suggested Questions
- How does AlpenSign compare to existing bank 2FA solutions like SMS OTP or push notifications?
- What happens if a client disputes a payment that has an AlpenSign seal?
- How does the TEEPIN/SKR economic model prevent fraudulent device attestation?
- What's the regulatory path for AlpenSign under eIDAS and Swiss ZertES?
- How does AlpenSign handle credential revocation if a device is compromised?
- What happens when a user loses their Seeker phone? How long does device replacement take?
- What's the transaction cost per seal on Solana?
- How does AlpenSign address the Visa 3D-Secure use case specifically?
